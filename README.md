## class overview

The classes are sorted into [shared](/Shared/) classes that are used by both applications and [AR](/AR/) and [VR](/VR/) classes that are only used by one of the applications.

### Data Sending

To enable communication between the AR and VR application, we provide the `LocalDataSource.cs` basecalass that can send and recieve serialized objects using a Web-RTC DataChannel. 

### Marker System

To enable the VR user to place markers in the world of the AR user, we created the `MarkerSyncronizer.cs` that syncronizes them between the applications. The VR app then uses the `MarkerSystem.cs` to enable the VR user to place new markers. The `SteamVRController.cs` handles the SteamVR inputs. The `MarkerPlaceMachine.cs` class allows the AR user to mark the position of the machine that requires maintenance.

### Spatial System

To share the Spatial mapping of the environment of the AR user with the VR user, we use the `CustomObserver.cs` to send, and the `MeshReciever.cs` to recieve and display the mesh to the VR user.
